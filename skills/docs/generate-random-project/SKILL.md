# Random Project Generator for Training

Generate detailed, realistic full-stack web/mobile app project specifications for team training purposes. The generated project is output in client questionnaire format and automatically triggers `/generate-prd` to create a comprehensive PRD.

---

## Usage

```bash
/generate-random-project
```

---

## Difficulty Scale

| Level | Complexity | User Types | Main Features | 3rd Party Integrations |
|:-----:|:-----------|:-----------|:--------------|:-----------------------|
| 1 | Simple | 1-2 types | 3-5 features | 0-1 integrations |
| 2 | Basic | 2 types | 5-7 features | 1-2 integrations |
| 3 | Medium | 2-3 types | 7-10 features | 2-3 integrations |
| 4 | Complex | 3-4 types | 10-15 features | 3-5 integrations |
| 5 | Expert | 4+ types | 15+ features | 5+ integrations |

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Select Project Configuration

Use **AskUserQuestion** to prompt the user for project configuration options.

**Question 1: Difficulty Level** (single select)

```
Question: "Select the project difficulty level"
Header: "Difficulty"
Options:
  1. "Level 1 (Simple)" - 1-2 user types, 3-5 features, 0-1 integrations
  2. "Level 2 (Basic)" - 2 user types, 5-7 features, 1-2 integrations
  3. "Level 3 (Medium)" - 2-3 user types, 7-10 features, 2-3 integrations
  4. "Level 4 (Complex)" - 3-4 user types, 10-15 features, 3-5 integrations
```

If user selects "Other", ask for Level 5 (Expert): 4+ user types, 15+ features, 5+ integrations

**Question 2: Backend Framework** (single select)

```
Question: "Select the backend framework"
Header: "Backend"
Options:
  1. "NestJS" - TypeScript-based Node.js framework with enterprise architecture
  2. "Django" - Python-based framework with batteries-included approach
```

**Question 3: Frontend Framework** (single select)

```
Question: "Select the frontend framework"
Header: "Frontend"
Options:
  1. "React" - Web application using React.js
  2. "React Native" - Mobile application using React Native
```

**Question 4: Admin Dashboard** (single select)

```
Question: "Include an admin dashboard?"
Header: "Dashboard"
Options:
  1. "Yes" - Include React-based admin dashboard
  2. "No" - No separate dashboard needed
```

**Store selections as:**
- `$DIFFICULTY` = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
- `$BACKEND` = "nestjs" | "django"
- `$FRONTEND` = "react" | "react-native"
- `$DASHBOARD` = "yes" | "no"

---

### Step 1.5: Check Existing Projects (Duplicate Prevention)

Before generating a new project, scan existing projects to avoid duplicates.

**Scan directories:**
```bash
ls .claude-project/training/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} basename {} .md | cut -d'_' -f1 | sort -u
ls .claude-project/prd/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} basename {} .md | sed 's/_PRD_.*//' | sort -u
```

**Store existing project names:**
- Extract project names from training files (format: `[ProjectName]_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`)
- Extract project names from PRD files (format: `[ProjectName]_PRD_YYMMDD.md`)
- Create a combined list of existing project names: `$EXISTING_PROJECTS`

**Duplicate prevention rules:**
1. When generating an app name in Step 3.1, check against `$EXISTING_PROJECTS`
2. If the generated name already exists:
   - First attempt: Add a unique suffix (e.g., "QuickBite" → "QuickBite Pro", "QuickBite Plus", "QuickBite Express")
   - Second attempt: If still duplicate, select a different app name entirely
   - Third attempt: If the domain is exhausted, select a different domain and regenerate
3. The final app name **MUST** be unique before proceeding to Step 4

**Available name suffixes for duplicates:**
- Pro, Plus, Elite, Express, Hub, Connect, Link, Go, Now, Max

---

### Step 2: Select Random Domain

Randomly select one domain from the following list. Each domain comes with associated characteristics.

| Domain | Example App Types | Common User Types |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Healthcare | Telemedicine, Patient Management, Fitness Tracking | Patient, Doctor, Admin, Caregiver |
| Education | LMS, Tutoring Platform, Course Marketplace | Student, Teacher, Parent, Admin |
| E-commerce | Marketplace, B2B Platform, Subscription Box | Buyer, Seller, Admin, Delivery Partner |
| Social | Community Platform, Dating App, Professional Network | User, Creator, Moderator, Admin |
| Fitness | Workout App, Personal Training, Nutrition Tracker | User, Trainer, Nutritionist, Admin |
| Finance | Budgeting App, Investment Platform, P2P Lending | User, Advisor, Investor, Admin |
| Food Delivery | Restaurant Ordering, Meal Prep, Grocery Delivery | Customer, Restaurant, Driver, Admin |
| Real Estate | Property Listing, Rental Management, Agent Platform | Buyer/Renter, Agent, Landlord, Admin |
| Travel | Booking Platform, Travel Planning, Tour Guide | Traveler, Host, Guide, Admin |
| Entertainment | Streaming, Event Booking, Gaming | User, Creator, Organizer, Admin |
| Logistics | Fleet Management, Warehouse, Delivery Tracking | Driver, Manager, Client, Admin |
| HR/Recruitment | Job Board, ATS, Employee Management | Candidate, Recruiter, Employee, Admin |

### Step 3: Generate Project Details Based on Difficulty

Generate realistic project details scaled to the selected difficulty level.

#### 3.1 Basic Information

**App Name Generation:**
- Combine domain-relevant prefix with creative suffix
- Examples: "MediConnect", "LearnHub Pro", "FitTrack Elite", "QuickBite"
- **CRITICAL: Validate against `$EXISTING_PROJECTS` from Step 1.5**
- If name already exists in `$EXISTING_PROJECTS`:
  1. Try adding suffixes: "Pro", "Plus", "Elite", "Express", "Hub", "Connect", "Link", "Go", "Now", "Max"
  2. If still duplicate, generate a completely different name for the same domain
  3. If all attempts fail for this domain, select a different domain and regenerate

**App Type Selection (based on tech stack):**
- If `$FRONTEND` = "react" → Web
- If `$FRONTEND` = "react-native" → App
- If `$DASHBOARD` = "yes" → + Admin Dashboard

**User Types Generation:**
- Select appropriate number of user types from domain list based on difficulty
- Define clear roles and permissions for each
- Create realistic relationships (1:1, 1:N, etc.)

#### 3.2 Design Reference

Generate realistic design references:
- Reference 1-3 real apps in similar domain
- Specify unique selling points/differentiators
- Select appropriate color scheme (professional for B2B, vibrant for consumer)
- Suggest appropriate fonts

```

---

### Step 5: Save Output File

**Create output directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude-project/training
```

**Save file:**
- Location: `.claude-project/training/`
- Filename format: `[ProjectName]_[YYMMDD_HHMMSS].md`
- Sanitize project name: Replace spaces with underscores, remove special characters
- Example: `HealthBridge_260115_143022.md`

---

### Step 6: Report Generation Summary

Output a summary before triggering PRD generation. **Always display the full absolute path** to the generated file:

```markdown
## Random Project Generated

### Project Details
- **Project Name:** [Generated Name]
- **Domain:** [Selected Domain]
- **Difficulty:** Level [N] ([Complexity Name])
- **User Types:** [Count] types
- **Main Features:** [Count] features
- **Integrations:** [Count] 3rd party services

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** [NestJS / Django]
- **Frontend:** [React / React Native]
- **Dashboard:** [Yes / No]

### Output File
**Full Path:** `/Users/dongsub/Documents/Potential/projects/claude-base/.claude-project/training/[filename].md`

### Next Step
Triggering /generate-prd with the generated file...
```

**Note:** The full absolute path must be displayed so users can easily reference or manually trigger `/generate-prd` with the correct path.

---

### Step 7: Trigger /generate-prd

After saving the file, automatically trigger the PRD generation using the **full absolute path** of the generated training file:

```
/generate-prd /Users/dongsub/Documents/Potential/projects/claude-base/.claude-project/training/[filename].md
```

**Example with actual filename:**
```
/generate-prd /Users/dongsub/Documents/Potential/projects/claude-base/.claude-project/training/HealthBridge_260115_143022.md
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the complete absolute path when triggering `/generate-prd`. The path format is:
```
[PROJECT_ROOT]/.claude-project/training/[ProjectName]_[YYMMDD_HHMMSS].md
```

This will:
1. Read the generated client questionnaire from the training file
2. Generate a comprehensive PRD document
3. Save the PRD to `.claude-project/prd/`

---

### Step 8: Generate PDF from PRD

After `/generate-prd` completes successfully, convert the PRD markdown to PDF:

```
/md-to-pdf .claude-project/prd/[ProjectName]_PRD_[YYMMDD].md
```

**Example:**
```
/md-to-pdf .claude-project/prd/HealthBridge_Pro_PRD_260115.md
```

This creates a PDF at `.claude-project/prd/[ProjectName]_PRD_[YYMMDD].pdf`

---

## Error Handling

**File save error:**
```
Error: Unable to save training project file.
Please check write permissions for .claude-project/training/ directory.
```
